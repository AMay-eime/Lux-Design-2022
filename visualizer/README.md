# Lux AI Challenge: Season 2 Visualizer

This is the codebase for the Season 2 competition visualizer. The latest version is hosted on TODO.

## Development

The visualizer is a **Typescript** **React** app, with React replaced with **Preact** + **`preact/compat`**, built on **Vite**. It uses **SCSS Modules** for styling, and **@mui/base** for component primitives. [TODO: add linting]

Run `npm run dev` to start the server and go to `http://localhost:5173`

Make sure whenever a change is made, the version is bumped in `package.json`.

Whenever the game engine has a breaking change, update the major version number.
